  This Arduino project uses a Bluetooth serial modem, a parallel LCD display, and your Android phone to 
  demonstrate how an Arduino can communicate with an Android device.
  
  I have added nothing new here; just taken other people's existing work to guide you on how 
  Arduino and Android can talk to each other through Bluetooth.  I created this from the Arduino LCD Display example (Igoe, Fried, Mellis),
  NewSoftSerial (Fried, Hart), and Google Bluetooth Chat.  Anyone is free to use this software as they wish. Mark Bieschke, 4/2011.
  
  Instructions for this project:
  1. Download Google's "Bluetooth Chat" Android example for your target Android version.  In the BluetoothChatService class, change the MY_UUID value to :00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB as follows:
      private static final UUID MY_UUID = UUID.fromString("00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB");
      Save, Run, and plug your Android phone into your USB so the code deploys to your Android phone (can't use a Virtual device).  
      On your phone, go to "Settings - Applications - Development" and make sure you turned on USB debugging.
  2. Hook up your parallel LCD and BlueSMiRF Gold Bluetooth modem to your Arduino and deploy this code to your Arduino.  
      See my diagrams on how to wire up everything on instructables.com.
  3. Through hyperterminal (or TeraTerm), make sure you have changed your BlueSMiRF Gold BAUD rate to 57.6k.  It defaults to 115k.
  4. Open up the Android Chat native app on your phone: press the Android menu button, "Connect a Device", then select "Firefly".  
      Now you have paired Android to Arduino.  You may need to type passcode: 1234.
  5. Type and send a message from Android phone to Arduino through the text message box in the Bluetooth Chat Android app.
  6. See an Arduino-generated String ("Hello from Arduino") appear on your Android device's LCD about 30 seconds after you connect, then again 30 seconds later.
      I decided to do this as an easy, maybe lazy, way to send a test message from Arduino to Android.  

Parts list:
1. Arduino Board - I used an Uno (328, 16MHz, 5V)
2. Bluetooth Modem - BlueSMiRF Gold (Sparkfun sku: WRL-00582)
    Set BAUD to 57.6k using Hyperterminal or TeraTerm
    commands to set BAUD: www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/Bluetooth/rn-bluetooth-um.pdf
3. Parallel LCD - Basic 16x2 Character LCD (Sparkfun sku: LCD-09051)
    Don't forget a 10k potentiometer so you can adjust contrast (a must have)
4. Android device with Bluetooth - I used a Motorola Droid for test
5. wires to connect Arduino, Bluetooth modem, LCD
6. Power supply for your Arduino
    
Software:
1. Arduino software
2. NewSoftSerial library from Mikal Hart.  http://arduiniana.org/libraries/newsoftserial/
    His library is better than the built-in "Serial." implementation.
3. Eclipse with Android Development Kit.  Make sure you follow Google's directions for downloading and installing ADK.
4. "Bluetooth Chat" sample code from Google. http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/BluetoothChat/index.html
    Super important: In the BluetoothChatService class, change the MY_UUID value to :00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
    - this is a common machine UUID that allows Android to communicate with the FireFly Bluetooth module
    - save and then run; deploy to actual Android phone because you can't use a virtual device because a virtual device doesn't have Bluetooth

/**************** Serial Port instructions *****************************
  NewSoftSerial allows us to create a serial communications port out of thin air on pins 2 (RX) and 3 (TX) to communicate with
  the Bluetooth modem (which then communicates to Android device via Bluetooth).  
  The built-in Arduino Serial communication to the computer is on pins 0 and 1 and we don't need to mess with 
  those pins because we may want to communicate with the computer through pins 0 and 1 so that's why we create 
  another serial port on pins 2 and 3.
  
  The Bluetooth modem I used defaults to 115k BAUD which is too fast for Arduino to receive from Android
  At low BUAD, like 9600, Arduino sends a "choppy" message to Android (I don't 
  know how to better articulate it but go ahead and try to connect at 9600 and see what I mean).  
  To change from 115k default baud, using hyperterminal, 
  put the Bluetooth modem in "command" mode ($$$) and change to 57.6k BAUD (su,57).  Get back in "data" mode (---) for Arduino to communicate with the BlueSMiRF Gold.
